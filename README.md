## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔥 **Thermal calculations**:  
  Includes temperature differences, Prandtl, Reynolds, Nusselt numbers, heat transfer coefficients, and total heat transfer.

- 🧱 **Structural calculations**:  
  Calculates effective area, flow rates, cross-sectional areas, number of channels, and geometric characteristics of the plate pack.

- 💧 **Hydromechanical calculations** (new):  
  Computes flow velocities and hydraulic resistances based on actual medium properties and geometry.

- 📊 **Clean UI with grouped sections**:  
  Inputs, constants, and result tables are well organized by category.

- 🔁 **Reusability**:  
  Universal formula logic separated from formatting, allowing accurate scientific outputs and unit-safe calculations.

- 🌡️ **Built-in constants**:  
  Includes plate properties, thermal characteristics of water, and preset assumptions.

- ✅ Rounds all final results to 3 significant decimal digits (when necessary).
